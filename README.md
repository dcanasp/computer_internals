# Computer Internals simulator in Go

This project simulates the internals of a compiler and a von Neumann architecture computer, complete with a **CPU**, **memory**, **ASSEMBLER**, **LEXICAL PARSER** among others. The system is written in **Go** and **flex**

The goal of this project is to better understand the fundamentals of computer systems

# Features

- Custom binary language instruction set
- CPU that understands those instructions
- Memory and register management
- Custom assembler for it
- Lexical parser


# Usage
Assuming you have both flex, go, and an initial input on a .txt file. Just run the makefile
```sh
make
```

To avoid some unwanted warning. The input.txt file must end on **LR** instead of *CRLF*


# Instruction Set

Hereâ€™s the complete list of supported instructions:
